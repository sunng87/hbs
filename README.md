# hbs

Real-world Clojure templating, seriously. Don't talk about enlive or
hiccup on a clojure web development book any more.

* Never ruin your Clojure code with HTML
* Never ruin your HTML code with Clojure
* Templating without reuse mechanism is shit
* Templating without customization is nothing but shit

What handlebars has?

* Separate your Clojure and HTML, calm down both
* Reuse your handlebars template with **include**, **partial** and **block**
* Create your own **helpers** for your infinite customization needs

This library is based on [handlebars.java](https://github.com/jknack/handlebars.java/).

## Usage

### Leiningen

![https://clojars.org/link](https://clojars.org/hbs/latest-version.svg)

### Using hbs.core

```clojure
(require '[hbs.core :as hbs])

;; render template string
(render "Hello {{person.name}}" {:person {:name "World"}})

;; render template file with a registry
(def reg (registry (classpath-loader "/templates" ".tpl")))
(render-file reg "hello" {:name "World"})

```

### Using hbs in Ring application

hbs library provides a default ring middleware
`hbs.core/wrap-handlebars-template` to generate pages from standard
response: `{:hbs {:template ... :context ...}}`

```clojure
;; ring handler function that generate handlebars response
(defn some-handler [req]
  ;;...
  {:hbs {:template "index"
         :context {:a "A" :b "B"}}})
```

By default, hbs middleware use `text/html; charset=utf-8` as content
type. You can override it by setting `{:headers {"Content-Type" ...}}`
explicitly in your response.

### Extending hbs.helper

Handlebars is nothing without **helpers**.

```clojure
(use '[hbs core helper])

;; def a helper
(defhelper mytag [ctx options]
  (safe-str "HelloWorld, " (clojure.string/upper ctx)))

(def reg (registry (classpath-loader "/templates" ".tpl")))

;; register the helper into registry
(register-helper! registry "mytag" mytag)

(render "{{mytag foo}}" {:foo "bar"})

```

### Using javascript helpers
Helpers can also be defined using javascript. Javascript helpers
are registered using register-js-helpers!-function
```clojure
(register-js-helpers! registry "path/to/file.js")
```

### Helpers defined by me

I have some predefined helpers used in my projects. And I decide to
ship it in the release.

To use these helpers, be sure eval `hbs.ext`. You can
just add a `(:require [hbs.ext])` on you core namespace.

Available helpers:

* ifequals
* ifgreater
* ifless
* ifcontains
* uppercase
* lowercase
* or
* count
* format-date
* format
* ifempty
* max
* min

You can find usage examples of these helpers in the test case `test/hbs/ext_test.clj`.

### Accessing clojure values

By default, `hbs` library provides a `clj-value-resolver` that accepts both keywords and strings

```clojure
(hbs/render "{{ person.name }}" {:person {"name" "World"}})
=> "World"
```

Between strings and keywords, it will prefer strings


```clojure
(hbs/render "{{ person.name }}" {:person {:name "from kw"
                                          "name" "from str"}})
=> "from str"
```

you can also extend and implement your own value resolver

```clojure
(hbs/render "{{ person_name }}"
  (-> {:person/name "world"}
    Context/newBuilder
    (.push (into-array ValueResolver [;; if you want, you use the standard hbs first. And just "complement" it.
                                      hbs/clj-value-resolver
                                      (reify ValueResolver
                                        (resolve [_ context ident]
                                          (get context (some-> ident
                                                         (string/replace #"_" "/")
                                                         keyword)
                                            ValueResolver/UNRESOLVED)))]))
    .build))
=> "world"
```
